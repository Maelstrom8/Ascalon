# Gameplay Documentation

I did not really mention it in the primary readme, but while Ascalon is a lightly modded list with educational purposes, it is also a list that is partially made up of mods from the user [LDKSuperDante](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/users/23347084). I really like the cut of his jib. I strive to include as much as I can from him, granted they are up to date.

Here is a list of mods, though.

## Visuals

I was almost going to include the optimized nude mod, but I was able to stop myself. Some armors look weird when the bandage(s) are removed anyway.

- [Cleaner Female Body Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/472) -- Contains improved textures for both genders. LDK also included an update to HD Icons in this.
- [Easy Clothing ID and HD Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479) -- LDK's combination of Easy Clothing ID & HD Icons.
- [Don't Blind Me](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/39) -- Visual improvements for glows from spells etc
- [HD HP - Custom GUI Textures/Icon Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/97) -- Self-explanatory.
- [Mega Hair & Beards 2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/467) -- Self-explanatory.

## Gameplay

- [A Fortress Besieged Quest Improved Boss Fight](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/683) -- Small adjustment to a quest to make it more interesting
- [Spell Mod Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/379) -- Not a literal "spell mod pack", you can't make new stuff, this just changes the existing spells a little
- [Pawn Stars](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/87) -- Enhances offline pawns.

## Main Menu / Audio

- [10th Anniversary Loading Screen](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/719) -- Self-explanatory.
- [Dragon's Dogma Main Menu OST: Coils of Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/94). Main Menu OST was replacing with Coils of Light - English Version. I love the song.
- [Dragon's Dogma Online Music Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/733) -- A bunch of tracks in-game were replaced with tracks from Dragon's Dogma Online

## Outfits, Armors & Weapons

Most of it is from LDKSuperDante. I didn't like any of the 'switch around armor ids to make transmogs' mods. I don't want an armor's appearence replacing another, they're kinda annoying. I didn't like many of the other edits to outfits as well. There is a mod called DD Restyling for example that made weird edits to clothing coverage.. it's just bad in my opinion.

- [LDK's Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/721) -- Contains a collection of improved resolution on armor.
- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Sneak Peek](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/479?tab=description). Contains 4K versions of some armor, and items.
- [Real Steel](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/494) -- Contains some weapons with texture improvements.
- [Alchemical Cloak - No Clipping Cloaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/140) --They were fixed so they don't clip through the body, may or may not have been overwritten by another mod
- [Sovereigns Mantle - No Clipping Cloaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/140) -- They were fixed so they don't clip through the body, may or may not have been overwritten by another mod
- [Wyrm Hunt Mantle - No Clipping Cloaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/140) -- They were fixed so they don't clip through the body, may or may not have been overwritten by another mod

- PROVIDED AS AN OPTIONAL MOD 

[Black Retextures & More](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/5) -- Colors a lot of armors, mostly assassin-themed ones black. Unless you are mod savy, it makes me choose between this or LDK's stuff. Also I wasn't sure if I wanted to turn a lot of stuff black.

## Environment

These contain texture improvements for Gran Soren and Gransys. The resolution is 4K. There was another texture improvement project that had several parts to it, but I'd.. rather wait until Dragon's Dogma 2 then try to overhaul the game like the Skyrim modders do.

- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Final Sneak Peek - Gran Soren](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/492?tab=description) -- Contains only Gran Soren
- [Remastering Dragon's Dogma Sneak Peek 2 - Gransys](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/mods/489?tab=description)
