Ascalon is what I'd call vanilla plus. I mean, there isn't a lot you can really mod the game with, but for now the base list doesn't have anything too drastic. If you want to modify it, skip to the bottom.

I'm a huge fan of all of [LDKSuperDante](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma/users/23347084)'s mods. I strive to use as many as them as I can, the updated ones anyway. 

Ascalon's mods are as follows:

## Visuals
