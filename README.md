# THIS IS A MANDATORY READ ME, STOP RIGHT THERE AND READ

THIS README IS NOT OPTIONAL, YOU MUST READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE HITTING PLAY IN MO2 - THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN IT SIMPLY NOT WORKING - THIS IS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF CERTAIN MODS IN A SECONDARY PROFILE NOT BEING SAFE FOR ONLINE PLAY (FOR PAWNS). So read it all.

# Introduction

Huge fan of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Played it back in the day on the PS3, joined the Official Pawn Sharing Club, had a lot of fun. Bought the game on Steam back in 2016, added probably 200+ people.. probably played for about a good year or two before I stopped. Haven't played it since. I haven't really played with mods before, I've seen them but.. I was more of a vanilla-guy for DD:DA. After spending a bunch of time modding Skyrim and replaying other games.. well I can say that has changed.

Ascalon is dual-purpose modlist for Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen that I have been working on for about a month now. The primary goal is to provide two profiles; a standard profile that has LDKSuperDante's "Remastering Dragon's Dogma" series, featuring armor, environment and weapon retextures and also includes some other popular mods - this is meant for more vanilla-like experience or to be new player friendly. The secondary profile consists of parameter tweaking mods like Jump Height, Carry Weight, Augment effects.. these are more experimental and depending on deep you go, you CANNOT have your pawn set to online when using some of them. They are meant to be for veterans.

The secondary goal / purpose is where I include mod templates and provide documentation on the modding elements, so users can mix and match mods if they feel they don't like a certain mod on one of the profiles. Along with that, I feel this is a list that will help further people's knowledge/fun for DD:DA modding until well.. Dragon's Dogma 2 releases.

# Requirements

You need to own a legitimate copy of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen. Also, your installation needs to be clean / unmodified. 

For the base game's requirements.. it's 6 years old. If you have a computer that wasn't built 20 years ago, you should be able to run it at 60 fps.

# Installation

## Steam Setup

I only support the Steam version of DD:DA. Not GoG, or any platform that may have it. I have no plans to support them at this time.

You need to have a clean un-modified version of DD:DA. Do this by verifying files through the game's properties. You can also back-up data this way.

# Wabbajack Instructions

Small walk-through for installing Wabbajack for those who have not used Wabbajack yet. For those who don't need to install WJ - skip ahead to xxx

#### Installing Wabbajack

Download the [latest version of Wabbajack]((https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases)) on this github and place it in a folder such as `C:\Wabbajack`. Do not extract it to your Steamlibary / DD:DA directory, Program Files, or User Directories like Documents, Downloads and so forth. You can use an SSD to speed up the process, but for such a small list you don't really NEED one.

#### Installing Ascalon 

1. Open Wabbajack and click `Browse Modlists`
2. Tick on the `Show Unofficial lists` option in the top right corner of Wabbajack
3. Press the download button on Arisen and wait for it to download.
4. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\Games\Ascalon. Follow the directory rules above.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. In the small time it takes to install, I recommend you spend your time reading this readme - as it's more important than your average readme
7. ???
8. Profit

#### Nexus Premium vs Non-Premium

If you have Premium, WJ will request a Nexus login and use the api to download all mods automatically. Without Premium, you'll be prompted to manually download the mods. Premium isn't needed for such a small amount of mods as this list has, but it will help.
